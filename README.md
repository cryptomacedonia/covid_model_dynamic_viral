# Dynamic viral model
Covid simulation based on MESA, easy to adapt and experiment with different strategies without programming complex agent based  systems from scratch

Igor Jovcevski Model COVID-19 / MACEDONIA


Cycle of temporal infection  is around 7 days which overlaps with periodic spikes in all areas


Having only “few’ infected introduced doesn’t cause widespread infection as this temporal infection fades quickly and stops the clusters .

A community that has certain “social interaction” score  must have certain number of infections (cutoff point) to sustain continual increase of infections

There is a cut off value of number of infections under which clusters cannot cause widespread infection outside their area

Cutoff point depends on:
	1. Population density
	2. Public transport usage

Finding cutoff point:

	1. Screening certain cities by randomly testing 0.1% of population every day 
	2. Areas with higher percentage of positive tests - introduce local restrictions ( not more than 7 days in cycle) 
	3. Lift the lockdown on percentage below threshold -  infection numbers will wane off themselves
	
Symptomatic cases may arise :
	1. after multiple “mucosal” exposures 
	2. Vitamin D3 status 
	3. Immune specificity variance at time of exposure


Presumptions:
	
Virus is widespread and multiple exposures happen in most individuals
Most of the exposures do not cause symptomatic disease and are stopped without adaptive response
Lack of detection of other respiratory pathogens may be related to continuous exposure to Covid-19 which may prevent co-infection with seasonal influenza
